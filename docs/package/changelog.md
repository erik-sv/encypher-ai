# Changelog

This document provides a chronological list of notable changes for each version of EncypherAI.

## 2.1.0 (05-04-2025)

### Added
- `generationID` as an optional standard metadata field in `embed_metadata` and all related APIs.
- Documentation updates to clarify standard metadata fields: `signer_id` (mandatory), `timestamp` (mandatory), `model_id` (recommended), `generationID` (optional), `custom_metadata` (optional).
- Integration guides for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, LiteLLM updated to show field mapping and new signature usage.
- API reference and user guides updated with explicit examples and field status.
- All code and documentation examples now use `version: 2.1.0` in metadata.

### Changed
- All guides and API docs now consistently explain and enforce the metadata field standard for interoperability.
- Improved clarity and modularity in code and documentation examples.

### Fixed
- Ensured custom_metadata cannot overwrite standard fields in payload construction.
